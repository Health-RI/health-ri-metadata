# Health RI Metadata Schemas

HealthRI metadata schemas draft project, aiming to define the HealthRI core metadata schema using DCAT and other standards to publish in a FAIR Data Point. This is part of the Health RI portal project (extension of Health RI COVID portal https://covid19initiatives.health-ri.nl/). The core metadata schema can also be used as a guideline for other portals. 
The core metadata schema can be extended to COVID metadata, Cohort Metadata, Dementia Metadata, governance aspects (Accessibility) etc.
