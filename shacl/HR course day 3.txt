waarom aanspreken met elkaar moeilijk

-look in
-could lead a team that leads themselves, trying to balance freedom w responsibility, same mission, wokring together same mission same problems
-empathy, connecting w people at their level, makes it more open
-developed: actually taking responsibility to be the leader not only in the background


look future
-in my team, we will need to prepare for a change since it is project based
we prepare for that drafting sustainability plans
-it takes time, networking, back and forward w team and their PIs, it takes planning to know what tasks can be taken up before project ends, a bit of timing works,
-i want to improve leadership in general, take time to learn about myself and what identify what can i develop; learn how to motivate people that are in general overloaded and that are embedded in this culture of taking up "second priority" tasks.
